#Coding Results:
# Part 1: 
The coding in part 1 of the automation project is supposed to log all suspicious data from a system security log. It is supposed to log this data to a different 
file. We ran the code and it succeeded in logging this suspicious data to another file. 
# Part 2:
The coding in part 2 was supposed to check to see the memory and cpu usage. It would print them out and store them in another file. If the cpu usage exceeded safe 
values it would print out an alert message. We ran the code and it printed out the data and stored it in a file. The cpu usage never exceeded safe values though
so we couldn't test to see if it would print out an alert.
# Part 3:
The coding in part 3 was supposed to do alerts like in part 2 but for both memory and cpu. It was supposed to constantly run and print out the memory and cpu 
values while sending an email alert if they exceeded safe values. I had it run for a while before stopping it. It printed out the memory and cpu value every couple
seconds. The values never exceeded safe standards so it never sent an email alert.
# Part 4: 
The coding in part 4 was just automating part 3. This is done by just letting the code in part 3 run on forever basically.
