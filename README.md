# CYSE-130-Project
#Project Overview: This project focuses on designing and implementing a robust cybersecurity system for a mid-sized financial services company that has recently experienced several security incidents, including a data breach and unauthorized access attempts. The goal of this system is to significantly enhance the company's security posture, mitigate cybersecurity risks, and ensure compliance with relevant industry regulations

# Guide:
#If you open the documentation file of this github project you can download our systems requirements and diagram file. Over there you can see what changes you should make to your system to make it more secure. In the scripts file you can see the code we have. You can copy and past that into a python developer and run it. Make sure to get rid of the text that isn't code. Also make sure to change the file name that the code checks for security warnings.
